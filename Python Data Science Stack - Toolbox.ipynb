    "Here you're going to check out Python's built-in scope, which is really just a built-in module called builtins. However, to query builtins, you'll need to import builtins 'because the name builtins is not itself built in...No, Iâ€™m serious!' (Learning Python, 5th edition, Mark Lutz). After executing import builtins in the IPython Shell, execute dir(builtins) to print a list of all the names in the module builtins."

    "So far, you've used lambda functions to write short, simple functions as well as to redefine functions with simple functionality. The best use case for lambda functions, however, are for when you want these simple functionalities to be anonymously embedded within larger expressions. What that means is that the functionality is not stored in the environment, unlike a function defined with def. To understand this idea better, you will use a lambda function in the context of the map() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the video that map() applies a function over an object, such as a list. Here, you can use lambda functions to define the function that map() will use to process the object. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "\n",
    "result = map(lambda a: a ** 2, nums)\n",
    "You can see here that a lambda function, which raises a value a to the power of 2, is passed to map() alongside a list of numbers, nums. The map object that results from the call to map() is stored in result. You will now practice the use of lambda functions with map(). For this exercise, you will map the functionality of the add_bangs() function you defined in previous exercises over a list of strings."
